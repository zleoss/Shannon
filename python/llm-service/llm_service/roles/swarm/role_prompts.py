【一句话功能】
  Swarm V2 角色专有 prompt 片段（三层架构的 Layer 2）。
【关键内容】
  SWARM_ROLE_PROMPTS[role] 提供角色方法论
  “lead” 不在 SWARM_ROLE_PROMPTS（独立 prompt）
  仅为方法指导，非完整 system prompt
【协作关系】
  被 agent_protocol.py 组合成最终 system prompt，供 agent step 使用。

【原 docstring】
  Role-specific prompt snippets for Swarm V2 agents.

  These are Layer 2 of the 3-layer prompt architecture:
    Layer 1: AGENT_LOOP_SYSTEM_PROMPT (core protocol, same for all agents)
    Layer 2: SWARM_ROLE_PROMPTS[role] (role-specific methodology)
    Layer 3: Dynamic context (task description, team state, iteration context)

  Design decisions (from architecture review 2026-02-20):
  - "lead" role is NOT in SWARM_ROLE_PROMPTS (Lead has its own dedicated prompt)
  - Role prompts are methodology guidance, NOT full system prompts
  - get_swarm_role_catalog() returns roles available for Lead to assign
